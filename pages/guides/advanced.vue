      <h1>Movement</h1>

      Slam storage may be used to increase sliding speed and jump distance. This may be achieved by slamming while on a
      wall,
      or jumping, then slamming rapidly.
      Slide-jumping may be achieved by sliding then jumping whilst pressing on the slide keybind. This achieves a long
      distance jump.
      Rocket surfing may be done by freeze-framing a rocket and jumping on top of it, this may be done several times
      while
      mid-air.
      The red(firestarter) rocket launcher’s secondary (gasoline spill), will result in an increased speed due to the
      slipperiness of the secondary.

      <h1>Style rating</h1>
      Style ratings are modifiers done through achieving style modifiers and the amount of kills in a single area. Style
      modifiers are special modifiers that are achieved through various means while killing enemies (i,e, exploded,
      ricoshot,
      projectile parrying, etc). Getting an ULTRAKILL rating will require genuine creativity and tactical
      desicion-making in
      game.


      <h1>P-Ranking</h1>
      P-Ranking is the game’s version of fully clearing an entire level. P-ranks are achieved by:
      Completing the level under a certain time limit (S),
      Killing all enemies in the level (S),
      Achieving a style level above a certain limit (S),
      All without any deaths in the level.
