        BASICS
      </UltraKillGuide>
      <h1>Movement</h1>

      By default, the game uses WASD to move, and space to jump, as per most pc games. Pressing space on a wall will
      prompt a
      wall jump, though it can only be used three times on the wall. Left Shift prompts V1 to dash, depleting the
      stamina bar.
      Left control in air prompts a ground slam, which can be stacked for a fast slide, or to kill weaker enemies. Left
      control on the ground will prompt a slide. These keys can be changed in OPTIONS.

      <h1>Shooting</h1>

      Left click on a mouse will result in a primary fire for the weapon, while right clicks will result in a special
      secondary fire for the weapon. The first weapon received will be the Piercer (or Blue) Revolver, found in 0-1 INTO
      THE
      FIRE in the prelude. The second weapon obtained will be the Core Eject (Blue) Shotgun from 0-3 DOUBLE DOWN.
      Variants can
      be obtained in the terminal, with other honorable mentions being the Marksman (green/coin) revolver, and the
      Sawed-on
      (red) Shotgun.

      <h1>Punching</h1>

      Punching is done using the F key on default settings, this can be changed in OPTIONS. The default arm is the
      Feedbacker
      (blue) arm, and is obtained from the start. The feedbacker can be used to parry shots when timed well (usually
      with a
      yellow flash denoting a parryable attack). The arm can be used to punch normally, exerting little damage. Other
      arms
      will be obtainable in <Redacted/> and <Redacted/>, after the fight with <Redacted/> Arms can be used to cause
      damage,
      which causes blood to spill. This will cause V1 to regenerate health (as it is fueled with blood.) Parries will
      also
      cause V1 to regenerate health, depending on how powerful the attack was.
